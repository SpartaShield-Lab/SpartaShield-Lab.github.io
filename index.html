    🛡️ SpartaShield Lab — Cybersecurity with Attitude

    SpartaShield Lab is a next-gen experimental cybersecurity project born in chaos and powered by code.

    We're not your average antivirus company. We don’t wear ties. We build custom tools, scanners, traps, and digital defenses — forged in memes, tested in virtual battlefields, and sharpened by caffeine.

    🔹 Real protection, zero boredom.

    🔹 Made for devs, by a dev.

    🔹 Open to chaos. Closed to malware.

    From custom threat scanners to meme-grade UI with military-grade backbone — SpartaShield Lab is your digital hoplite in the war against cyber threats.

    Optional tagline ideas:

    🛡️ "This. Is. Cybersecurity."

    ⚔️ "Built in Sparta. Runs on caffeine."

    💻 "Protecting your system — with style."
